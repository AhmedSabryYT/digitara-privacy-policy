<h1>Privacy Policy for Digitara</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Digitara</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) handles user information, ensures privacy, and provides guidance on app usage, including bug reporting and app functionality.</p>

<h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
<p>Digitara is a fully offline calculator app designed to perform all calculations locally on your device. Unlike other apps, Digitara does not collect, store, or share any personal data or usage information.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not ask for your name, email, phone number, or any personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li>We do not track, record, or log your app usage, button presses, calculations, or session data.</li>
    <li>We do not send any data to servers, cloud services, or third-party analytics providers.</li>
    <li>All calculations and data generated within the app remain on your device and are not transmitted in any form.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using Digitara, you can be assured that your calculations and device activity are <strong>completely private</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. Device Permissions</h2>
<p>Digitara is designed to require no special permissions beyond basic app installation. It does not request access to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contacts</li>
    <li>Camera</li>
    <li>Microphone</li>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Storage (beyond saving internal temporary calculations, if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures maximum user privacy and prevents any potential misuse of device resources.</p>

<h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Digitara is suitable for users of all ages. Since the app does not collect any data, it is fully compliant with regulations concerning children’s privacy. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

<p>Parents and guardians can confidently allow children to use the app, knowing that all calculations remain on the device and no personal data is gathered.</p>

<h2>4. Security of Information</h2>
<p>Because Digitara does not collect or store any personal or usage data, there is no personal information that could be compromised.</p>

<p>All calculations are performed locally and reside only in the app’s memory temporarily while the app is running. Once the app is closed, no historical usage is saved.</p>

<p>We encourage users to keep their device secure through normal device security measures (e.g., screen lock, device encryption), but no security breach can expose data from Digitara because no user data is ever stored.</p>

<h2>5. Bug Reporting and App Functionality</h2>
<p>While Digitara is designed to be stable, users may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior due to device variations or operating system updates.</p>

<p>If you encounter any bugs, glitches, or crashes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Please restart the app and attempt the calculation again.</li>
    <li>If the problem persists, you can report the issue via email: <a href="mailto:ahmedredasabryy@gmail.com">ahmedredasabryy@gmail.com</a>. Please include a description of the problem, your device model, and your operating system version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bug reports are used solely to improve app performance and fix errors. These reports do not contain personal data and are handled only for development purposes.</p>

<h2>6. Updates and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Digitara may receive updates to improve performance, add features, or fix bugs. We recommend updating to the latest version to ensure optimal functionality and security.</p>

<p>No updates will add data collection or tracking. Digitara will always remain fully offline.</p>

<h2>7. About This App</h2>
